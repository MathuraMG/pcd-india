  <h3> Processing Community Day </h3>
  Processing Community Day(PCD) is a Community driven event, to celebrate Art, Code and Diversity. It is a worldwide event and mainly runs for a full day or two. The first PCD Delhi event was held on January 27, 2019 at Timeblur Studio in New Delhi.
  <br>PCD brings together Artists, Coders, and Technologists , but also Scientists, Researchers, Designers, Engineers, and Hobbyists together to share their ideas, work, research with eachother. They could be from any cultural, educational or professional background. Our objective for the event is to encourage the community to think algorithmically, and draw inpiration from eachother to work fearlessly with code. We are open to have any age group to our community, and have no bias towards one specifically.

  <h3> What is Processing?</h3>
  Processing is a Visual programming platform for everyone to use. The makers of Processing tool, Casey Reas and Ben Fry have made the language simple and easy for anyone to quickly make fun sketches with it in no time. You can make shapes, add color, add interactions with mouse, and do more complex stuff like fractals and simulations in Processing. There is an amazing community support for Processing tool. There is <a href="http://processing.org/" target="_blank">Processing</a> main website, <a href="https://thecodingtrain.com/" target="_blank">Coding Train</a> on Youtube and <a href="http://openprocessing.org/" target="_blank">OpenProcessing</a> to get started with Processing. They have also released <a href="http://openprocessing.org/https://p5js.org/" target="_blank">P5.js</a> which is to make your Sketch work on Web.
