  Processing Community Day is a community event that will bring together people of all ages to celebrate and explore art, code, and diversity. The day-long event features fun filled workshops on making generative art from simple lines of code and interaction spaces to make playful artworks.
  <br>You'll learn few tricks and play with p5 to add life to a character or to just create beautiful 10 prints with a machine. No prior coding experience is really required to make it, just a ton of curiosity to learn and understand how programs work
