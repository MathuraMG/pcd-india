          Processing Community Day (PCD) is a day to celebrate and explore art, code, and diversity around the world.  We define the format of our event in any way that serves our local communities. What does that mean? - aside from the conventional lecture / demo format, our PCD can be a show & tell session, a zine-making session, an audio-visual performance, a DIY art show, a game jam, a group discussion on software art or ALL OF THE ABOVE.

          <a class="link highlight" href="https://processing.org/" target="_blank">Processing</a> is a free and open-source software platform for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts, created by Casey Reas and Ben Fry. It is complemented by a web version, called <a class="link highlight" href="https://p5js.org/" target="_blank">p5.js</a>, created by Lauren McCarthy. To date, Processing and p5.js are used by a worldwide community of artists, coders, educators, students.
        </p>
        <p class="para">
          A focus of this project is to make learning how to program and make creative work with code accessible to diverse communities, especially those who might not otherwise have access to these tools and resources. The first Processing Community Day (PCD), organized by Taeyoon Choi and the Processing Foundation in 2017 was one of our efforts to improve diversity within the art and programming community. Taking place at the MIT Media Lab, PCD 2017 drew community members from all over the east coast to get together in person to meet, share what they're working on, to learn, and collaborate.

              <span class="highlight">Harshit Agrawal</span> is a new media artist and human computer interaction (HCI) researcher. Through his artwork, he wants to create experiences for people to explore and express with seemingly distant technologies like artificial intelligence/ machine learning, drones, digital fabrication, sensors, augmented reality and in the process invite people to reflect upon and re-evaluate their relationship with technology. We live within a complex sphere of technical processes, and seldom do our experiences make us stop and come face to face with them, sit down and have a conversation with them, become comfortable with them to a level that we start reflecting on how they are truly affecting us and evolving our viewpoint of the world. As an artist, Harshit wants to create alternate lenses for looking at the influences that technology has on us. A lot of his current work focuses on the interplay between human and artificial intelligence, imagination and intention, spanning across virtual and physical embodiments. Harshit is a graduate of the MIT Media Lab and IIT Guwahati, both places which have helped him build and situate his practice as artistic, societal and technical enquiries.

Pursuing my bachelors degree in Architecture at the beautiful campus of IIT Kharagpur, I explored how computers can be taught what good design is. I have researched on emotion driven urban planning at ETH Zurich and AR based Educational Interface at MIT Media Lab. Processing has been a key component in my learning process and I would love to share the joy I found with many more learners.”
