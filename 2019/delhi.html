      <h2 class="sub-title left "> About This Event </h2>
      <p class="para left">
        PCD @ Delhi is a community event that will bring together people of all ages to celebrate and explore art, code, and diversity. The day-long event features fun filled workshops on making generative art from simple lines of code and interaction spaces to make playful artworks.
        <br><br>
        On the Day of the event, you'll learn few tricks and play with p5 to add life to a character or to just create beautiful 10 prints with a machine. No prior coding experience is really required to make it, just a ton of curiosity to learn and understand how programs work?
       <br><br>
        In addition to a full day of programming, we want to make space for anyone to share ideas and projects with the community. We will set up Show & Tell Stations, an Interactive sketch screen to get your ideas on the wall, and a Community Open Mic Session for participants to sign-up on the day of the event. The program will wrap up with an after party consists of performances, food, and drinks.
