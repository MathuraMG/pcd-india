## PCD = Processing Community day

Hi there! Welcome to the PCD India web repository. This was made in 2019 as a way to get all the PCDs in India in one place, at least digitally, if not physically.

Here you can find the code for our website -> [https://processingindia.org/](https://processingindia.org/) 
You can also find the code for our website from last year -> [https://processingindia.org/2019/index.html](https://processingindia.org/2019/index.html)

Now here's a few ways to use this repository - 

## Are you from India? 
Yes?? Great! 
If you'd like to add yourself to this site - make a copy of this repository and make the below changes
* If you're planning a PCD in your city, you can add yourself to the list of PCD's happening in India over here -->
[Code to add yourself to add to the list of cities](https://github.com/MathuraMG/pcd-india/blob/master/index.html#L82) and link it to your page (more details on that in the next step)
* Create a folder within the repo with the name of your city. [Here's an example of Delhi](https://github.com/MathuraMG/pcd-india/tree/master/delhi)
* Within that folder host your index.html and all other related assets.
* You can also opt to copy the [Bangalore website](https://github.com/MathuraMG/pcd-india/blob/master/bangalore.html) and change the details to match your event.
* NOTE: Please do not change any of the files in the root folder or another cities folder other than adding your city in `index.html`

## Are you outside of India?
Well we are still happy for you to follow the steps above if you don't mind the url --> [https://processingindia.org/](https://processingindia.org/) 
Else, you can create a clone of this repo and modify it as needed for your city/ country

## Extra notes - 
* We currently own the domain processingindia.org and thus chose to host it there. However, if you do not have such a domain name, you can use services like github pages.
* With github pages - you can get links like --> pcdatmycity.github.io . [Here is a quick read on github pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site)

## Thank you!
* A huge thanks to everyone who have helped build this site.
