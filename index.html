          Processing Community Day (PCD) is a day to celebrate and explore art, code, and diversity around the world. What does that mean? - aside from the conventional lecture / demo format, our PCD can be a show & tell session, a zine-making session, an audio-visual performance, a DIY art show, a game jam, a group discussion on software art or ALL OF THE ABOVE.

          A focus of this project is to make learning how to program and make creative work with code accessible to diverse communities. Here's a snapshot of PCD India from last year
