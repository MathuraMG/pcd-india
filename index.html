          Processing Community Day (PCD) is a day to celebrate and explore art, code, and diversity around the world. What does that mean? - aside from the conventional lecture / demo format, our PCD can be a show & tell session, a zine-making session, an audio-visual performance, a DIY art show, a game jam, a group discussion on software art or ALL OF THE ABOVE.
